# Stopwatch Web Application

I've designed a web application utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, resulting in a fully functional stopwatch. This achievement underscores my ability to integrate these fundamental web technologies to create an interactive and practical solution. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in crafting the visual elements using HTML and CSS, while also implementing the stopwatch's dynamic behavior with JavaScript. This is a simple web application that functions as a stopwatch. It allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer, providing an interactive way to measure time.

## Features

- Start: Initiates the stopwatch timer.
- Stop: Pauses the timer.
- Reset: Resets the timer to zero.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Structuring the web page layout.
- CSS: Styling and formatting the visual elements.
- JavaScript: Handling stopwatch functionality and interactions.
