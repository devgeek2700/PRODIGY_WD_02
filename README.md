# Stopwatch Web Application

I've designed a web application utilizing HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, resulting in a fully functional stopwatch. This achievement underscores my ability to integrate these fundamental web technologies to create an interactive and practical solution. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in crafting the visual elements using HTML and CSS, while also implementing the stopwatch's dynamic behavior with JavaScript. This is a simple web application that functions as a stopwatch. It allows users to start, stop, and reset the timer, providing an interactive way to measure time.

## Features

- Start: Initiates the stopwatch timer.
- Stop: Pauses the timer.
- Reset: Resets the timer to zero.

## Technologies Used

- HTML: Structuring the web page layout.
- CSS: Styling and formatting the visual elements.
- JavaScript: Handling stopwatch functionality and interactions.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone git@github.com:devgeek2700/PRODIGY_WD_02.git

2. Open `index.html` in your preferred web browser to start using the stopwatch.

## Usage

1. Click the "Start" button to begin the stopwatch timer.
2. Press "Stop" to pause the timer.
3. Use the "Reset" button to set the timer back to zero.
4. Click "Lap" to record a lap time while the stopwatch is running.
